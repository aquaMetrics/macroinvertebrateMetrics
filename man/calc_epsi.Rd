\title{Empirically-weighted Proportion of Sediment-sensitive Invertebrates (E-PSI)}
\usage{
calc_epsi(ecologyResults, taxaList = "TL2", logAbundance = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ecologyResults}{Dataframe with at least three columns
item{SAMPLE_ID} - unique idenftier for each sample
item{TAXON} - Taxon name that matches to macroinvertebrateTaxa dataset
item{RESULT} - Numeric log abundance category}

\item{taxaList}{The taxonomic level the sample(s) have been identified at
according to specificed taxa lists as described in WFD100 Further
Development of River Invertebrate Classification Tool. Either "TL2" - Taxa
or  "TL5" - Taxa list 5.}

\item{logAbundance}{If RESULT column in ecologyResults not log category then
set to FALSE. This will calculate log value from your numeric abundance.#'}
}
\value{
Dataframe with
item{SAMPLE_ID}
item{ANALYSIS_NAME}
item{DETERMINAND}
item{RESULT}
}
\description{
A sediment-sensitive macro-invertebrate metric that provides a proxy to
describe the extent to which the surface of river bed are composed, or
covered by sediments. It can be calculated at Taxonomic Levels 2 & 5
}
\examples{
sample <- demoEcologyResults
sample <- filter_psi(sample, taxaList = "TL2")
