#' SPEcies At Risk (SPEAR) metric
#'
#' Indicator based on biological traits used to detect effects of pesticides on
#' non-target freshwater invertebrate organisms. It can be calculated at
#' Taxonomic Levels 2, 4 and 5.
#'
#' @param ecologyResults
#' Dataframe of results with four columns: SAMPLE_NUMBER, TAXON, SPEAR_SPECIES,
#' RESULT
#' @param recoveryArea
#' There are 3 different paramaters depending on availability of "Recovery areas" information:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item "Absent" - No presence of recovery areas
#'   \item "Present" - Presence of recovery areas
#'   \item "Unknown" - No information available
#' }
#' @param taxaList The taxonomic level the sample(s) have been identified at
#'   according to specificed taxa lists as described in WFD100 Further
#'   Development of River Invertebrate Classification Tool. Either "TL2" - Taxa
#'   list 2, "TL4" - Taxa list 4 or  "TL5" - Taxa list 5.
